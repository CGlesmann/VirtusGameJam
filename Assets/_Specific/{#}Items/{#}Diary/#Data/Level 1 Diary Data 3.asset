  _text: "When I first heard of a human\u2019s DNA blending with the plague bacteria,
    I didn\u2019t believe it... month after month with no success was only sending
    everyone in the lab to the point of insanity. \r\n\r\nSubject C27 appeared to
    remain stable. The experiment was a success.\r\n\r\nI still don\u2019t know how
    they did it, but when I saw it with my own eyes\u2026 I knew we had made a terrible
    mistake."
