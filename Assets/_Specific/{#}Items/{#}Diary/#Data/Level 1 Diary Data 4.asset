  _text: "\rAfter the success of subject C27, the number of experiments tripled. We
    attempted to recreate the same positive results with our subjects, but with no
    luck. We only created mutated creatures that we decided to keep alive to monitor
    their behaviours. \r\n\r\nThat was 2 weeks ago and now the entire facility has
    been destroyed and overrun by these vile creatures. I know I will soon face my
    own death.\r\n\r\nWas this what Edgar wanted from the beginning? What was his
    final hypothesis? \r\n\r\nTo my loving family\u2026 I\u2019m sorry."
